# Ransomware
This project includes a simple Python ransomware application designed for modeling recursive 
encryption within directories. It features scripts for encrypting and decrypting files within 
the same directory.

## Components

- **RansomwareV1.py**: Script to encrypt files.
- **RansomwareDecryptV1.py**: Script to decrypt files.

## Key Notes

- Both the encryption and decryption scripts must use the same password to function correctly.
- The scripts only operate within the directory they are placed in, ensuring safety and 
simplicity for testing purposes.


 **Added Later**
 - WIP (Work In Progress)
 - GetToKnowYou.py: script for combing a machine for all data (network, fingerprint, location, credentials) before emailing it to target destination.
